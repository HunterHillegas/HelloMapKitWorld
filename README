This source code is a sample of how to use MapKit. Nothing fancy, just some demo / sample code.

This is a simple application that downloads some locations from a remote JSON file, parses them, inserts them into a Core Data database and then displays them on the map.

This app only took me about 1.5 hours to put together. It's very straightforward.

You can replace the constant that controls the JSON file location. The sample file is included in the package.

This also includes some third party, OSS code. Be sure to adhere to whatever licenses they include.
